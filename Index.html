             <h1>Why I write?</h1>
             <p> 	My short stories are easily said very random, I do not know where most of my ideas come from. I usually just sis down and suddenly I start imaginating the wierdest thing. When I was younger I would make up stories of what i did over any vacation, one time on Halloween ,October the 31st. I told my whole class that I went to a grave yard and my mom and stepdad hid behind a grave and scared me. In reality my sister was sick and we just stayed at home that night.  </p>
            
             <p>   Anyways back to story writing last year me and all my friends bought folders and began writing six to twenty page stories.All of our stories were teen fiction as in vampires and all of that.One year later I realized that wasn't in to that type of writing,my type of writing right now is Teen's realistic fiction.I honestly hate writing about anything that can't happen don't get me wrong I loved reading the Twlight series, Divergent series etc. I wanted my stories to be read by someone who would give me honest opinions, I know all my friends would say, "Oh, this is amazing." I wanted someone to tell me what was wrong with my writing so I could get better. So I turned to writing apps the app that I tried out and loved was Wattpad this app let me post chapters on my short stories and show it with strangers. I plan to post my whole first story on here when I get complety finished with it on this website but for know I will just give the description.</p>
